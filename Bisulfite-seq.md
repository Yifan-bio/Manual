# Introduction to Bisulfite sequencing

## Background



## Principle



# Pipelines for Bisulfite sequencing

> 

## Trimming


## Alignment

The alignemnt of ATAC-seq remains to be the few main alignment tools for genome alignment including bowtie2 and bwa.

## Post-alignment Filtering

As ATAC-seq is a very noisy technology, we will need to be able to include sufficient quality datasets
MT reeads

## DNA methylation calling


## Differential methylation


## Methylation Segmentation
